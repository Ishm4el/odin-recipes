      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p class="container">
        I've always loved making lemon chicken. It's relatively easy to make,
        and it is always so satisfying to eat and rich with protein. This dish
        will take 10 minutes to prep, 50 minutes to cook, so relatively an
        entire hour to make, which includes 4 servings.

        <li>0.5 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly grounded black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol class="container">
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly oil a large
          roasting pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place chicken and potatoes in a large bowl. Add lemon juice, olive
          oil, garlic, dried oregano, salt, rosemary, black pepper, and cayenne.
          Toss until chicken and potatoes are evenly coated.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place chicken pieces skin-side up in the prepared pan. Tuck potato
          pieces around chicken. Drizzle with 2/3 cup chicken broth. Spoon any
          remaining marinade from the bowl over chicken and potatoes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Toss chicken and potatoes,
          then place chicken skin-side up again.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continue baking until chicken is browned and cooked through, about 25
          minutes more; an instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone
          should register 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer chicken to a serving platter and keep warm; leave potatoes in
          the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          Turn on the broiler, or set oven to highest heat. Toss potatoes again
          to coat in pan juices. Place the pan under the broiler and broil until
          potatoes are crisped, about 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer potatoes to the platter with chicken.</li>
        <li>
          Place the roasting pan on the stovetop over medium heat. Add the
          remaining 1/3 cup chicken broth and scrape up browned bits from the
          bottom of the pan. Strain pan juices over chicken and potatoes.
          Sprinkle with fresh oregano.
        </li>
